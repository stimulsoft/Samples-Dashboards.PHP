## Running samples
The samples folder contains all the scripts and resources of the project, including the 'index.php' file. So all files from this folder are required to be copied on your PHP server, using FTP or HTTP access interface - depending on your hosting provider.

After that, in your browser, you can navigate to the following address:  
http://your-domain-name/index.php

If you are using a PHP server installed on your local development computer:  
http://localhost/index.php

## Composer
Additionally, the examples are ready to work with the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency manager. You can use the specified command to update the product and all dependencies to the latest available version:

```
composer update stimulsoft/dashboards-php
```
